A clean, simple, responsive and touch-friendly Carousel with no bells and whistles but plenty of flexibility. 

== Description ==

Slidr is a clean, simple, responsive and touch-friendly multi-purpose Carousel. It takes a different approach than most other carousel plugins on that it displays posts or custom posts instead of just gallery photos (but it can show gallery photos as well if you like). Its goal is to be as flexible as possible, allowing you to fully customize its appearance via CSS and even overriding the default HTML output.

= Features =
* Responsive.
* Touch friendly.
* Can accept variable width - fixed height images.
* You can call it via a shortcode on posts, pages and widgets.
* Supports cycling items (when at the end, clicking "next" loads the first item and so on, simulating a circular move).
* Autoscroll support.
* Customizable queries with more than a dozen of parameters. You can adjust the post type, number of entries, thumbnail size, order and many more.
* You can have different carousels with different queries and different parameters on a single page.
* You can call it conditionally, to load scripts and styles only when needed.
* It can display entries without photos. For example, you can show the titles and excerpts of your recent posts (or custom posts) and style them however you like.
* Using a special function you can override the text output for each item. For example, instead of the item's title and excerpt you can show an icon, some static text or something else.
* You can add your custom class on each shortcode, to style each carousel differently.
* Works on every recent version of all popular browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari) and it even supports Internet Explorer 8.

== Installation ==

1. Upload Slidr plugin to your WordPress plugins directory and activate it. 
2. Go to Tools > Slidr to customize its options and learn how to use the shortcode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I create a carousel? =

Just go to the page you want to show your carousel and add the [slidr] shortcode. This should create a carousel with the default settings, meaning that it will get all the recent posts and display them in descending order. You can customize the output by overriding the default settings with your own values like so: [slidr parameter="value"]. For a full list of the available parameters, see below.

= Carousel parameters =
* <code>[slidr height="some_number"]</code> : Set the height for the specific carousel, overriding the defaults like so: <code>[slidr height="200"]</code>. That way you can have carousels of different sizes in different pages of your website.
* <code>[slidr loader="no"]</code> : Shows a "loading" animation until all items are loaded. By default it is enabled.
* <code>[slidr cycle="yes"]</code> : If enabled, when the carousel reaches its first or last item, instead of stopping it loads the last or first item respectivelly, simulating a circular move. With <code>[slidr cycle="auto"]</code> you can enable autoscoll, which animates the carousel automatically every 4 seconds.
* <code>[slidr speed="4000"]</code> : Set the autoscroll speed in miliseconds. Default value is 4000ms (4 seconds). This option works only if "cycle" parameter, mentioned above, is set to "auto".
* <code>[slidr nav="hide"]</code> : Completely hides the navigation buttons.
* <code>[slidr gallery="yes"]</code> : Instead of posts, the Carousel can be used in "Gallery mode" displaying the images attached to the post in which you call it. By default it is disabled. You can use gallery mode with specific images, by providing the IDs of those images like so: <code>[slidr gallery="1,2,3"]</code>. If gallery mode is enabled, then other conflicting parameters such as post type or hide thumbnail will be ignored.
* <code>[slidr gallery_link="attachment"]</code> : Whether each item's link should lead to the attachment page or the actual media file if gallery mode is enabled. Default is the Media file. If gallery mode is set to "no" (disabled), then this setting is ignored.
* <code>[slidr type="post_type"]</code> : The post type whose items will be displayed in the carousel (e.g. <code>[slidr type="post"]</code> for posts, <code>[slidr type="page"]</code> for pages etc.). Default value is "post".
* <code>[slidr number=some_number]</code> : The number of items to be displayed. Pay attention to the lack of quotation marks (e.g. <code>[slidr number=15]</code>). Default value is 10.
* <code>[slidr category="category_id"]</code> : The category from which you want to get your items. You should use the categorie's ID like <code>[slidr category="2"]</code>. By default this option is disabled, to get all categories.
* <code>[slidr parent="parent_page_id"]</code> : Display the children of a page. You should use the page's ID like <code>[slidr parent="2"]</code>. By default this option is disabled.
* <code>[slidr sticky="yes"]</code> : By default the plugin doesn't care about whether a post is sticky. To only show sticky posts, though, use <code>[slidr sticky="yes"]</code>).
* <code>[slidr orderby="date"]</code> : The items' order. Default order is by date.
* <code>[slidr order="ASC"]</code> : Whether the order will be ascending (ASC) or descentind (DESC). Default is "DESC" (descending). If the gallery mode is enabled and is set to get specific images, then this order option gets ignored and the images are ordered based on how the user added the image IDs in his/her shortcode.
* <code>[slidr size="thumbnail"]</code> : The thumbnail size, based on the registered sizes of your theme. Default value is "thumbnail". Other options usually include "medium", "large" and "original".
* <code>[slidr thumb="no"]</code> : If you need the carousel to display posts without thumbnails, you can completely disable images. Default value is enabled, of course.
* <code>[slidr info_box="no"]</code> : By default each item shows a box with the title and excerpt on mouseover or tap. With this option you can disable it.
* <code>[slidr excerpt="no"]</code> : Hide the excerpt from the info box.
* <code>[slidr img_link="no"]</code> : Remove the link from each image.
* <code>[slidr class="yourclass"]</code> : If you have carousels in many different pages, there is a chance that you want to style them separately. With this option you can add a custom class at the carousel's outer container and customize it using CSS.

= Combinations and alternatives =

You can combine almost all of the above parameters to customize your query. For example, <code>[slidr type="portfolio" height="200" number=5 category="5" size="medium" excerpt="no" class="myworks" cycle="auto" speed="2000"]</code> should create a carousel of 200 pixels height which would display the five most recent items from your "portfolio" custom post type, AND under a specific category with the id of "5". Items' thumbnails should use the "medium" size and no excerpts should be displayed. Finally, this carousel should autoscroll its items every 2000ms (2 seconds) and it should have a custom class "myworks".

If you want to add your carousel directly in your php code, you can use the <code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode( '[slidr]' ); ?&gt;</code> function, setting parameters the same way as previously described.

= Can I have more than one carousels in my website? =

Yes. You can create carousels on any post or page you like. Each one of them can accept different parameters.  

= Can I create two carousels on the same page? =

Yes. You can have multiple carousels on the same page.

= Instead of the title and excerpt I want to display my own content / metadata. Can I customize that output myself? =

Perhaps you might want to alter the default display of the title and excerpt in the infobox. In that case, you can override the output by adding the following function in your theme's functions.php:
<code>
<?php function slidr_custom_content( $link, $title, $excerpt, $a ) {
	echo 'Your custom output here';
} ?>
</code>
You can call each item's link, title and excerpt using the <code>$link</code>, <code>$title</code> and <code>$excerpt</code> variables respectively inside your function (in the above example you should use it inside your echo). If you have more than one slidr shortcodes with different attributes for each one, you can run tests using the <code>$a</code> variable. For example, to test if gallery mode is disabled:
<code>
<?php function slidr_custom_content( $link, $title, $excerpt, $a ) {
	if($a['gallery'] !== 'yes') {
		// Do something
	}
} ?>
</code>

= Customizing conditional loading =
To further customize conditional loading of the plugin's resources, put the following in your theme's <strong>functions.php</strong> file:
<code>
<?php function slidr_conditional() {
	if( YOUR_CONDITIONS ) { 
		slidr_dequeue(); 
	}
}?>
</code>
For details on <strong>Conditional Tags</strong> check the [Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags "Conditional Tags in WordPress").

= Slidr in Widgets =
If you want to add a carousel in your WordPress Sidebar Widgets, you need to enable shortcodes in your WordPress sidebar. To do so, paste <code>add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');</code> in your <strong>functions.php</strong> file. Then all you have to do is go to your <strong>Appearance Â» Widgets</strong> Screen and create a <strong>text widget</strong>. There you can paste <code>[slidr]</code> (or any shortcode that you have enabled on your site for that matter), and it will function properly.

= Why is the design so minimal? =

Slidr's main goal is to be lightweight and flexible, with the minimum possible restrictions when it comes to its styling. It comes with a predefined template which can be decativated for those who want to use their custom design. Therefore, to modify its appearance you need to have at least some knowledge of CSS.
